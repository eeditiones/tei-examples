## Licence

Specify the licence under which your file is available. It should be also explicitly stated within the `<licence>` element in the teiHeader. Please note we can only accept openly licensed material.

## Files

Ideally create a zipped archive including all the files: xml sources, odd, facsimile images and page template. Otherwise you can provide links to these resources (if hosted online).

Avoid spaces and special characters (like `(` or `/`) in the filenames.

### TEI source file (.xml)

list xml files

### Facsimile(s)

list images

### Layout template (.html)

If you already have a TEI Publisher compatible layout template for presenting your material, include it in the zipped archive. Otherwise you can specify your requirements, ideally also providing a sketch with a brief description.

### ODD (.odd)

If you have an ODD file with processing models include it in the zipped archive.
